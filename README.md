# Sveto's Portfolio Website


# Aim
- I set my theme with strong colours because I like oil paintings. However it is difficult to work with strong colours and it will take time to make my portfolio a bit more stylish. My idea is to make the front page simple with strong colours. Want to include summer poppy flower motif, possibly wiht some animation to give more contemporary appearance.


# Design Process 1 – Mood board
- Figma was used to design graphics. Still need time to take some control of this tool.

# Design Process 2 – Font selection  
- I used Raleway and Crete Round fonts


# Technical challanges
- I was struggling a lot with the design process. In my previous work I was used to make all the coding and testing prior to making any cosmetic changes, so everything looked upside down to me. I had no inspiration. The colour palette I struggle to put in place in Figma just wasted my time and added to the frustration. All the palettes I have picked were not inline with my taste.
Finally my teachers helped me start and the work begun.

# Lessons learnt:
- Plan to rewrite this project when I get some spare time.


# Ok here is the website.
