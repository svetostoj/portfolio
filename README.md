# Sveto's Portfolio Website


# Aim

I set my theme with strong colours because I linke oil paintings. However it is difficult to work with strong colurs and it will take time to make my portfolio a bit more stylish. My idea is to make it simple with strong colours


# Design Process 1 – Mood board
Figma was used to design graphics. Still need time to take some control of this tool.

# Design Process 2 – Font selection  
I used Raleway and Crete Round fonts


# Technical challanges
- I was struglling a lot with the design process. In my work I was used to make all the codeing and testing prior to making any cosmetic changes, so everything looked upside down to me. I had no inspiration. The colour palette I strugle to put in place just vasted my time. All the palettes I have picked were not inline with my taste.
Filanly Rugen help me start and the work begun.

# Lessons learnt:
Still have to learn on this issue
